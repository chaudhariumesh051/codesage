# CodeOrbit Supabase Setup Instructions

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Connection Issues?

If you're seeing "Failed to fetch" errors, your Supabase credentials are likely incorrect or your project may be paused. Follow these steps carefully:

## Getting Your Supabase Credentials

To connect CodeOrbit to your Supabase database, you need to get your actual Supabase project credentials:

### Step 1: Access Your Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your project (or create a new one if you don't have one)

### Step 2: Check Project Status
1. Make sure your project is **ACTIVE** and not paused
2. If your project is paused, click "Resume" to reactivate it
3. Free tier projects pause after 1 week of inactivity

### Step 3: Get Your API Keys
1. In your project dashboard, click on the **Settings** icon in the left sidebar
2. Click on **API** in the settings menu
3. You'll see your project credentials:
   - **Project URL**: This is your `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **Project API keys**:
     - **anon public**: This is your `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     - **service_role secret**: This is your `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### Step 4: Update Your Environment Variables
1. Open your `.env` file in the project root
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-actual-service-role-key-here

# AI Services
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

### Step 5: Verify Your Credentials
1. Make sure your `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` follows this format: `https://[project-ref].supabase.co`
2. Make sure your `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is a long JWT token starting with `eyJ`
3. Double-check there are no extra spaces or characters

### Step 6: Restart Your Development Server
After updating the `.env` file:
1. Stop your development server (Ctrl+C)
2. Start it again with `npm run dev`
3. Check the browser console for any connection test messages

## Database Schema Overview

CodeOrbit uses a comprehensive database schema with the following main components:

### Authentication & User Management
- `user_profiles` - Extended user information beyond Supabase auth
- `user_sessions` - Multi-device session tracking
- `user_security_logs` - Security audit trail
- `user_preferences` - User settings and preferences

### Code Analysis System
- `code_submissions` - User code submissions
- `code_analyses` - AI analysis results
- `problem_solutions` - Generated solutions
- `code_execution_results` - Code execution history
- `flowcharts` - Generated flowcharts

### AI Assistant & Chat
- `chat_history` - AI conversation history
- `ai_models` - Available AI models
- `usage_tracking` - API usage tracking

### Learning & Challenges
- `challenges` - Coding challenges
- `user_progress` - Learning progress tracking
- `achievements` - User achievements system
- `user_achievements` - User-specific achievements
- `learning_paths` - Structured learning paths

### Subscription & Billing
- `subscription_plans` - Available subscription plans
- `user_subscriptions` - User subscription data
- `billing_history` - Payment history
- `usage_limits` - Feature usage limits

### Content & Media
- `videos` - Generated video content
- `file_uploads` - User uploaded files
- `exports` - Exported content

### Security & Compliance
- `audit_logs` - System audit trail
- `rate_limits` - API rate limiting
- `feature_flags` - Feature toggles

## Security Features

The database includes comprehensive security features:

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
- **User isolation** - Users can only access their own data
- **Admin access controls** - Admins have elevated permissions
- **Rate limiting** - Prevents API abuse
- **Audit logging** - Tracks all important actions
- **Session management** - Secure multi-device login tracking

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Failed to fetch" Error
- **Cause**: Incorrect Supabase URL or API key
- **Solution**: Double-check your credentials in the Supabase dashboard
- **Check**: Make sure your project is not paused

### "Invalid API key" Error
- **Cause**: Wrong API key or expired key
- **Solution**: Copy the anon key again from your Supabase dashboard

### "Network Error" or "CORS Error"
- **Cause**: Project is paused or URL is incorrect
- **Solution**: Resume your project and verify the URL format

### Connection Timeout
- **Cause**: Network issues or server problems
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection and try again

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your `.env` file to version control**
- The `anon` key is safe to use in client-side code
- The `service_role` key should only be used server-side (in edge functions)
- Keep your `service_role` key secret as it has admin privileges

## Troubleshooting Steps

If you're still getting authentication errors:

1. **Verify project status**: Ensure your Supabase project is active
2. **Double-check credentials**: Copy-paste keys directly from dashboard
3. **Check for typos**: Ensure no extra spaces or missing characters
4. **Clear browser cache**: Sometimes cached credentials cause issues
5. **Test connection**: Check browser console for connection test results
6. **Restart dev server**: Stop and start your development server
